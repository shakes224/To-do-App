# **CodeSpace Academy Project 3 To-Do App**
 

  ## Using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript I am going to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that helps users keep track of various tasks. I will make effective use of Object-Oriented Programming to build my application, as a result, I will plan it thoroughly before you start with coding.




  

The App should allow the user to perfom the following tasks

• Add tasks to the list

• Delete tasks from the list

• Edit tasks

• Add due dates to tasks

• Sort tasks alphabetically

• Strike through tasks on the list

• Save tasks in their expected states and order even after the browser has been closed
